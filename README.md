from computer arch point of view, 
reading from main memory is much better than reading from secondary memory (for cpu).

so as you can see, the execution time when reading more lines will be less than reading a line at a time.

# Note:
i know that time optimization i've done is kind of ridiculous, but its fair enough while we are only cares about the code style
